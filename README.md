# TO-DO-app
 To-do app with JS / HTML / CSS 
 
I developed this to-do app project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This included creating the layout, implementing responsive design, and adding visual elements to enhance the user experience. Also with a focus on meeting the criteria of ease of use(nice and minimalistic ui/ux design), functionality(implement the core features of to-do app, such as creating lists and tasks, count remaining tasks and deleting them), accessibility, responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

I used vanilla JavaScript to build this app, and also used different properties and methods of DOM, such as EventTarget.addEventListener(), Node.appendChild(), Event.preventDefault().

I learned a lot, during developing this project and it was really fun.
Hope, you'll use and enjoy it too!
